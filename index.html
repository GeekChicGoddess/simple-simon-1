-- PLAN PROJECT --

Planning out the project (for this morning)...

   a) write out all the rules for Simple Simon in your own words with clear and simple language
       - make sure you can clearly describe the game
       - make sure you understand all the steps of playing the game
       - make sure you understand how to pass a round and how to lose the game

       -user turns on game
       -user can turn on game by pressing any button
       -game starts by generating random color
       -the random color lights up on button
       -user clicks on button that lit up
       -game repeats color and adds another one to sequence
       -user repeats the sequence
       -if user replicates the correct sequence
            -game replicates same sequence and adds another random color
            -repeat rounds until user gets wrong
            -game makes sound to alert game over and buttons all blink
       -if user ges sequence wrong
            -game over
            -game starts over if user presses any button


   b) draft the logical steps of your game using pseudo-code (BE SPECIFIC - these steps will be the beginning of your comments)
       - consider any global variables you will need to define
       - consider all functions you will need to execute processes to run the game
       - consider all events you will need to interact with the game


       - each square needs to be able to flash when with clicked on or sequence is running
       - sequence needs to generated with random number 1-4
       - each number connects to different color button
       - sequence only generates one output
       - another number will generate if user gets previous sequence correct
       - sequence will have to remain the same after random numbers generated
       - start by having full random sequence in array and only allowing to play one at a time?
       - break from sequence if user gets wrong or reaches the end of sequence.


   c) consider what extra features you want to eventually add

      - on off button
      - reset button
      - a timer that ends game for user if they take too long
      - user gets score based off number of rounds


   d) plan out the design or theme you eventually will create

      - container with 4 divs to hold 4 boxes
      - make container have relative position
      - make boxes have absolute positioning
      - place each button at corner of container
      - resize boxes to take up most of the container
      - make box initial color dim
      - boxes light up during game
